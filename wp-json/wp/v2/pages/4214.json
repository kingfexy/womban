Post-operative massage therapy can be beneficial to speed up the recovery process, while reducing inflammation and minimizing soreness or pain after surgery.\u00a0\u2800\u2800<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">However, if you have not had surgery or a lymphatic massage, you might not know how to prepare for the massage or the pain after your surgery. With that in mind, we decided to share some helpful information regarding post-surgery massage and what to expect.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;60px&#8221;][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4215&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;30px&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<strong>Surgery Causes Swelling\u2014Lymphatic Massage Reduces It<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Every surgery causes some sort of swelling. The buildup of fluids in your body and around the surgical incision area needs to be relieved and eliminated. To prevent that build up, doctors often recommend compression garments and lymphatic massage. As you receive the massage, toxin-carrying fluids are flushed from your body properly. If the liquid is not drained, you risk getting complications. Lymphatic drainage massage is necessary to help prevent this occurrence. Manual massage activates the lymph nodes and improves lymph flow throughout the patient\u2019s body, which eliminates bruising, improves circulation, and ultimately helps the healing process.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;60px&#8221;][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<strong>Lymphatic Massage is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">NOT<\/span> a Traditional Massage<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Contrary to what you might think, lymphatic massage is not a traditional massage like deep tissue, Swedish massage, or hot stone. It is a specific technique that is both specialized and advanced.<\/p>\n<p>Gentle rotating, and pumping motions are used to gently move lymph fluid through your body.\u00a0\u00a0Never receive a deep tissue or therapeutic massage in place of a lymphatic massage\u2014the results will not be the same.<\/p>\n<p>Another common question is how many post-surgery massage treatments do I need? Typically, I recommend at least one or two treatments before your surgery. After surgery, that number changes based on the type of surgery you had and on the number of surgical areas and how the body is recovering. A minimum 10 massages are recommended. 1 every day for the first two weeks after your procedure, then can be spaced out to 3 sessions a week in consecutive order.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<strong>Support Your Lymphatic Post-Op Massage with These Tips<\/strong>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drink plenty of fluids.<\/li>\n<li>I can never stress this enough. Drink plenty of clean, mineral-rich water before and after your massage for the best results.<\/li>\n<li>Eat a healthy diet.<\/li>\n<li>Nutrient-dense foods also support your body from the inside out. Grab fruits and vegetables.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t stay on the couch or in the bed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>After your surgery, and more importantly after your massage, it\u2019s tempting to stay in bed or on the couch, but you actually need to move. Movement, such as walking, helps pump the lymph fluid and is supportive to your healing process. If you feel tired after your session, then honour your body by resting, but remember to incorporate some type of movement that is comfortable for you at the different stages of your healing process. \u00a0And, of course, always follow your Doctor\u2019s direction[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row row_content_width=&#8221;grid&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1588709087776{padding-top: 107px !important;padding-bottom: 94px !important;}&#8221; parallax_background_image=&#8221;4151&#8243;][vc_column offset=&#8221;vc_col-lg-offset-2 vc_col-lg-8&#8243;][vc_row_inner content_text_aligment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Reshape Your Body<\/span><\/h5>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;24px&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Body Sculpting Treatments Customized Personally For You<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;24px&#8221;]<a itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fresha.com\/bodyful-toronto-hnjtlbg6\/booking?menu=true\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #ffffff;border-color: #ffffff\" class=\"mkdf-btn mkdf-btn-medium mkdf-btn-outline mkdf-btn-custom-border-hover mkdf-btn-custom-hover-color mkdf-btn-icon\" data-hover-color=\"#eaeaea\" data-hover-border-color=\"#eaeaea\" >\n    <span class=\"mkdf-btn-text\">BOOK NOW<\/span>\n    <i class=\"mkdf-icon-font-awesome fa fa-calendar \" ><\/i><\/a>[\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row row_content_width=&#8221;grid&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1588614700672{padding-top: 150px !important;padding-bottom: 149px !important;}&#8221; simple_background_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221;][vc_column][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;30px&#8221;][vc_column_text] What You Need to Know About Post-Surgery Lymphatic Massage [\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text] After cosmetic surgery, the body is susceptible to physical pain in the underlying tissue, joints, and muscles.
